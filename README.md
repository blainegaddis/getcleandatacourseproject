Coursera - R Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository is Blaine Gaddis' submission for the course project in the R Getting and Cleaning Data course. It includes the instructions on how to run the analyses on the Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset
  * Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
  * CodeBook.md: A code book that describes the variables, data, and transformations/work I performed to clean and analyze the data.

  * README.md: This file.

  * run_analysis.R: Downloads data, cleans and prepares data for analysis, and completes the following 5 steps:
    * Merges the training and test data sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts the means and standard deviations for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    * Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  * FinalData.txt: The exported final data after completing the steps described above.
